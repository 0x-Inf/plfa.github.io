This book is an introduction to programming language theory, written
in Agda.  The authors are [Wen Kokke][wen] and [Philip Wadler][phil].

Please send us comments!  The text is currrently being drafted. The
first draft of Part I will be completed before the end of
March 2018. When that is done it will be announced here, and that would be
an excellent time to comment on the first part.

The book was inspired by [Software Foundations][sf], but presents the
material in a different way; see the [Preface](Preface).
